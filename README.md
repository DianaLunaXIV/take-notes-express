## Description
 > This Node.js app allows you to write, save, and delete notes by reading and writing to a db.json file. It uses Express.js as middleware to handle HTTP requests.

## Installation
 > The app requires Node.js. See Node's documentation for getting it installed. 1. Clone the repository. 2. Open the cloned repository in a terminal and run `npm i` to install Node module dependencies. 3. Run `node server.js` to deploy the backend. The terminal will tell you that the app is listening on a port. 4. In a web browser, navigate to localhost:PORT. 

## Usage
 > The app is deployed live at https://bb-take-notes-express.herokuapp.com/ and can be tested there. Click "get started" from the root page to get to the notes interface. From there, you can view notes already on the server by clicking the name of the note on the far left. You can delete them by clicking the trash can. To edit a selected note, press the pencil button, and then click in the text area to begin typing. To save it, press the floppy disc icon.

## Credits
 > This project was made possible in part thanks to the hard work of the uuid package developers (https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid), whose work greatly simplified the process of giving each note a unique ID. Thank you also to my roommate, Taylor, who helped me set up and understand JavaScript Promises in the context of this project.
